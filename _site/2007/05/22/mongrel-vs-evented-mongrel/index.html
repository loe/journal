    <h2>Mongrel vs Evented Mongrel</h2>

    <p class="pubdate">Posted on Tuesday, May 22, 2007</p>

    <p>Mongrel is just as fast as Evented Mongrel with a concurrency of 1, but under a concurrency of 10 the difference becomes clear. Evented Mongrel is able to maintain the same 270 req/sec whereas Generic Mongrel falls down to about 120 req/sec.</p>

<p>Hardware is a Celeron 2.4Ghz with 512MB of RAM running Debian Linux.</p>
