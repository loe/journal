    <h2>New England Dinghy Championship (Coast Guard Alumni Bowl)</h2>

    <p class="pubdate">Posted on Tuesday, May 08, 2007</p>

    <p>May 5-6 @ CGA in FJs &amp; 420s
A: Erik Storck/Killarney Loufek &amp; Anne Megargel
B: Andrew Loe/Betsy Bryant &amp; Matthew Cohen</p>

<p>Saturday: Crazy. Again, seems to be the theme at Coast Guard this year. Day started with a dying Northerly that was predicted to shift to a nice Southerly sea-breeze. Didn&rsquo;t happen. The two breezes fought all day and we were caught right in the middle. Only 4 races were completed, and they were extremely questionable at that. We finished the day tied for 4th, but it was still very early.</p>

<p>Sunday: Strong Northerly! The forecasted 15-20 showed up! We got a full morning of sailing in (4 races) before a lunch break and fleet swap (I started in 420s and went to FJs). The afternoon was not as nice, some sketchy conditions, but we made it work and finished 3rd to qualify for nationals!</p>

<p>Sunday was a great day of sailing, unfortunately the results don&rsquo;t quite show it. Matty and I rounded the first three marks of the first three races in first. (Yay alliteration) We had a 3, 1, 4, and 2 &ndash; great results in breeze. The afternoon went strangely, Betsy and I had two deep races (13, 12) but around them we had a 1, 1, 2. Sometimes our strategy just wouldn&rsquo;t work out. In the end we finished 3rd in B and 3rd overall.</p>

<p>Qualifying put Dartmouth on the elite list of schools that qualified for all three spring nationals, a testament to the strength of our team and program.</p>
