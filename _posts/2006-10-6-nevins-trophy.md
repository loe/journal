title: Nevins Trophy

September 16-17 @ USMMA (King's Point) in FJs & 420s<br />
A: Erik Storck/Kate Hacker<br />
B: Andrew Loe/Betsy Bryant

Saturday: Dying breeze, only got in 5 races. Current was interesting, but not really a factor, was pretty uniform across the course. We were over one start, came back to 15, but nearly doubled our point total in once race!

Sunday:  Dying breeze, only two races counted, but we got enough points on people to win the Division!

First in B!
