Insane.

<a href="http://expn.go.com/expn/story?pageName=wx11_results_snbpipew">Women's Snowboard Pipe Finals</a>: Kelly Clark was the most impressive in my mind, she is getting out of the pipe and landing technical moves. Great to see a woman not afraid to push the limits, truly carrying her speed.

<a href="http://expn.go.com/expn/story?pageName=wx11_results_skipipem">Men's Ski Pipe Finals</a>: Unreal. Simon Dumont throwing 1260s 20+ ft. out of an 18 ft. pipe (thats 3-4 stories high from the flat). Tanner Hall with switch 1080... Peter Olenick doing the double flat-spin (essentially a double back-flip late 180)... Insane.

Se√±or Blanco qualified first in the <a href="http://expn.go.com/expn/story?pageName=wx11_results_snbstylem">Men's Slopestyle</a>. The finals will be tomorrow at 1 PM EST on ABC. I'm pulling for big Andreas Wiig, the big 6' Norwegian. The Men's Snowboard Pipe Finals will be on Sunday night - I can't wait. If you missed anything, there is tons of video, including all the medal-winning runs, on <a href="http://expn.com/">EXPN.com</a>.
