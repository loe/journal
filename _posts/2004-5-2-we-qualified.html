title: We Qualified!
---
Yesterday we started out extremely well and went undefeated through the first round robbin. Today we completed a round of 8 and a final four. After being mathematically locked into qualifying, Scott decided it best to not sail since his ankle was hurt and Scotty L sailed in his place. We had a poor showing in the final four, loosing all of our races - but we still qualify and thats all we really cared about. Props to Harvard who won and Brown who also qualified. Regatta report is on the ICSA mailing list.
