title: New Tire
---
I went 4 wheeling yesterday, and managed to split the sidewall on one of my tires! I'll have to get a new tire to replace it as the hole is pretty big. The annoying thing was, when the spare tire was put on, the shop used air tools and broke the weld that holds the stud in place. This meant that I couldn't get the spare off to switch! I had to drive out on a flat and get the truck towed to shop with a welding machine. Sucked, but part of the game.
