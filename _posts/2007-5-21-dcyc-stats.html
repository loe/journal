We didn't have too much wind on Saturday morning so we decided to measure ourselves. I ended up being the tallest, but I Paul Durkee (D 06') has the longest arms. Adele Wilhelm is the tallest girl, and Betsy Bryant is the smallest. It's amazingly ironic that Betsy crews for both the tallest boy and the tallest girl. It was really cool to see Jon Kling's (D 04', Thayer 06') numbers. His arms are 4 1/8" longer than his height, a crazy positive APE index in climbing parlance.

Wingspans (check out how the shorter people are marked lower, it graphs like height vs 1/wingspan):<br />
