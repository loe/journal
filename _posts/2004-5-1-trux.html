I just uploaded some video from the Trux regatta that I sailed this spring - it shows me doing quite well in the first race (ended up third) and some footage of Peter Fleming who was sailing B Division. I was sailing with Jimmy Attridge 07'. <a href="http://andrewloe.com/public/sailing/trux062b.wmv">Trux Video</a>.
