title: Hiking Mt. Zion
---
Mallory and I traveled to the Olympic Peninsula to hike up Mt. Zion in Olympic National Forest. The trip there turned into quite a journey. We had to wait a while for the ferry, and we did some off-road driving in my not-so-off-road car -- but we eventually found our way. The hike was short but steep. At the top we were rewarded with some beautiful vistas of the Puget Sound, and the Olympic and Cascade Mountain Ranges. During our epic journey we also discovered a babbling brook, a gnome home, and a few other surprises. <a href="http://gallery.andrewloe.com/view/life/mt-zion/">Full Photo Set</a>.
