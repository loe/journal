title: World of Warcraft

I've been playing the <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a> beta for the last two days, and I'm hooked. This game is awesome. I'd never played an MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) before, and now I see what I was missing. I have a few different characters but my main guy is a Level 9 Human Paladin. I'm getting pretty strong, but I don't have the time that some crazy people do. I've run into level 30+ players - the beta came out on monday - these guys must just play 24/7.

Anyways, if you haven't yet, I'd suggest you check this out as its worth the long download. I will be buying it when it comes to the store.
