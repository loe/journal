Mallory and I spent a beautiful weekend practicing for "29er":http://www.29er.org/ Nationals in the Gorge. "505 North Americans":http://www.usa505.org/usa/regattas/2008/NorthAmericans/ were going on at the same "venue":http://www.cgra.org/, which provided plenty of entertainment between our practice sessions.
