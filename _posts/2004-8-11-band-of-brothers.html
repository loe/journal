title: Band of Brothers
---
I've been watching the <a href="http://www.hbo.com/band/series/currahee.html">Band of Brothers</a> Series and I am totally hooked. The cinematography is amazing. Each of the parts is done by a different director, and focused on a different event.  There is a common theme throughout all the parts (done by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg) so they fit, but each one works on its own. I'd highly suggest watching them.
