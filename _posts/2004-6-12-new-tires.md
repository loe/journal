title: New Tires
---
It looks like I'm going to be changing out the tires on the <a href="/gallery/FJ60">FJ60</a> to 33x12.50 <a href="http://www.bfgoodrichtires.com/bfgapp/catalog/tires/allterraintako.jsp">BFG All-Terrains</a>. I've found a guy in Denim Springs that wants to buy the old mud tires. The BFGs will do much better on snow and ice, and will be much nicer to drive up to New Hampshire on.
