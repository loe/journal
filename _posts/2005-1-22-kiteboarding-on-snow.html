title: Kiteboarding... on snow!
---
Well tomorrow I'll be doing something I've never done before. Clementine's brother is a pro kiteboarder, so she has a kite that we're going to try to use on a snowboard. I've been kiteboarding on water before so I should be able to figure it out pretty quickly, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to generate enough edge hold to really get some speed. The good thing is its a trainer kite, so its only 3 meters long. Typically thats not enough for someone my size to use in the water (not enough lift to keep me out), but since the kite doesn't have to hold me up, it should work perfectly. If it does work - its going to be awesome, I can test out any trick I want in the air, and have zero worries about harsh landings! Totally tits.
