title: The Scoop de Oop

Went snowlerboarding again today, K got 7" of fresh snow overnight, that coupled with the 22" they got on Thursday/Friday made for an awesome day of riding. I'm getting very confident on the jumps and am about to bust out my tricks to the world. Pictures forthcoming, for now check out how lame I used to be: <a href="http://gallery.andrewloe.com/Snowboarding/">Snowboarding Pictures</a>.
