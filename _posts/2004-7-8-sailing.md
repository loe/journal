I wanted to throw down an update on the summer sailing dealio. The team I was on for the Charles River TR didn't get in because our registration didn't make it on time. The coach for MIT was in Charleston at the Youths and didn't get our registration until the day before the event. I had also planned to sail the Falmouth TR this weekend but that has fallen though because I can't find a boat. If you know anyone witha  V-15 in New England that I can use please tell me! Hopefully I'll do BBR and maybe some 420 events, but that all remains to be seen.
