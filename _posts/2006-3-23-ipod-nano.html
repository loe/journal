After dropping my 3G iPod a few weeks back, I finally was able to replace it with a snazzy new 4GB Black <a href="http://apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod nano</a>. Pretty snazzy little device, I'm hoping it will make me listen to new music as I can't fit all of mine on it, I'll be rotating albums. Snazzy.
