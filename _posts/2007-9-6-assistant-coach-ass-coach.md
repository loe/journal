title: Assistant Coach (Ass Coach?)
---
I got my first job out of college... this fall I will be the assistant coach for <a href="http://dartmouthsports.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=11600&KEY=&SPID=4693&SPSID=48740">Dartmouth Sailing</a> while our new coaches are sailing the Olympic Trials. Should be a fun, low-key transition while I continue to search for a more permanent position.
