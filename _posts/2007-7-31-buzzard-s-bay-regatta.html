title: Buzzard's Bay Regatta
---
<a href="http://buzzardsbayregatta.com/">BBR</a> is one of the best events on the summer sailing circuit. I'll be heading down on Thursday night with Anne Megargel to sail V-15s. I'm psyched to get out of Hanover and, and even more psyched for the consistent sea breeze!
