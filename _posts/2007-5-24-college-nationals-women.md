The women are on their second day of the <a href="http://www.collegesailing.org/nas/spring07/">nationals</a> today. Dartmouth started off rocky, but we seem to be recovering lead by some sailing by Adele Wilhelm and Kate Hacker in B division. Follow <a href="http://www.collegesailing.org/nas/spring07/results.asp?RegattaID=201">the results</a> online.


Update: The women finished 12th.
