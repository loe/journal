title: Harry Anderson Trophy

September 2-3 @ Yale in 420s<br />
A: Erik Storck/Kate Hacker & Jimmy Attridge<br />
B: Andrew Loe/Betsy Bryant & Kate Hacker

Saturday: Hurricane remnants made for an interesting day. We got one set off in 3-25, then A went out for 2nd set and a huge puffed rolled through causing a large portion of the fleet to flip. Racers were sent in, and eventually all racing was called for the day. We got back to the hotel pretty tired and crashed/watched football/hung out.

Sunday: Slow race management, so we only got 3 sets off (for a total of 8 races in each division). Moderate conditions, built to a nice 12 knots for the final set. We ended up winning B division, and finishing second overall.

First in B!
