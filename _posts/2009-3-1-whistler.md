title: Whistler and the Epic Birthday Celebration
---
For my 25th birthday my posse and I journeyed north to Canadia in search of two mystical mountains: Whislter and Blackcomb. We left Seattle on Tuesday afternoon and made it to Whistler in time for dinner at the brewery.

Day 1: Since most people chose to rent gear in Whistler Village, we spent the first day on Whistler Mountain. The Loes ventured up to the top of the mountain, and found some excellent vistas. For dinner we enjoyed a traditional gumbo prepared by chef Willie.

<p>Hello Padres:

Day 2: Blackcomb was host for the day. With our legs warmed up, John and I checked out some of the more technical terrain on the back side while everyone else cruised the groomers. The snow on the glacier was excellent, but the upper bowls were lacking coverage. For dinner everyone met at 21 Steps in Whistler Village. Our waiter was interesting to say the least, but he did prove himself by bringing a few extra drinks. The food was good, and the company was excellent.

<p>Pop!

Day 3: The prettiest day of the trip. Everyone was able to experience the new <a href="http://www.peak2peakgondola.com/">Peak 2 Peak Gondola</a> during the ideal weather. John and I checked out the excellent parks on Blackcomb, including the pipe and the kiddie rail garden. We had an tasty chili with Fritos for dinner before heading out to the Village for some apres ski drinks and music.

Day 4: Last day! We started on Blackcomb, and rode hard until 2pm. At 2 everyone converged on Rendezvous Lodge for a sit-down lunch at Christine's. After all the drinks and food we migrated back to Whistler via the Peak 2 Peak and rode the gondola down. We finished the day on the mountain at Dunn's Irish Pub. With everyone thoroughly exhausted, we had Lasagna and watched Travis Rice's <a href="http://www.thatsit-thatsall.com/">That's It That's All</a> before passing out.
 
<p>Oh hai:

After a hearty breakfast on Sunday morning, we drove back to Seattle. The wait at the border was tough but eventually we made it.
