title: Airblaster! Leg Bag
---
Well I've been lucky enough to find an <a href="http://www.myairblaster.com/">Airblaster</a> <a href="http://myairblaster.com/legbag.htm">Leg Bag</a>. Most stores sold out in the first few hours, but a local to Killington has an extra he is willing to sell for retail. Soon I will be an owner of a blue and orange <a href="http://myairblaster.com/legbag.htm">Leg Bag</a>! Why? They're awesome, they're funny, they're pointless.
