I've put up a little banner in support of <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a>, <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a>'s charity in support of sick and hospitalized children. A wise lady once told me that we should give enough to feel a pinch in order truly understand how blessed we are, and because its the right thing to do. Make sure when you get linked the to the Amazon lists you check out all the hospital options (like Tulane in New Orleans), there are more than those shown on the map.
