title: I got a job! but still no Internet :(

Well the updates are not supposed to be this sparse. The huge influx of seasonal residents has backed up the internet guys. My install date is the 20th, two weeks after I ordered. Ouch. Once I DO get intarweb, I'll try to write a little bit every day.

In other news: I got a job! I'm an official Jackson Hole Mountain Resort (JHMR) Snowboard Instructor. Training starts Monday, and then they let me loose with the kiddies.... Good times.
