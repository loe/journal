title: Happy 4th!

Happy 4th of July! (A few hours late :-P) I've been busy getting organized with school and life but I haven't forgotten about this site. I'm also working on a community site for sailing, I hope to unite all the mailing lists and get some good content going. I am not looking to make money off this project, just for it to be self-sufficient. I will also not be making "Rufus" my cell phone glucose monitor since I flat out do not have the time and motivation for it.
