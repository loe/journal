title: del.icio.us and Firefox
---
The guys over at <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> have released a really cool <a href="http://mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a> <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615">plug-in</a> that integrates the social bookmarking service into your browser. I've played with del.icio.us in the past, but the experience was never streamlined or fast; this plug-in is both. There is more explanation on the <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2007/04/making_firefox_.html">del.icio.us blog</a>.
