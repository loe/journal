title: Lighthouse Bugzilla Importer
---
I have looking at some alternatives to <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> for managing my projects. <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> was too simple, <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> tries to do too much, but I think <a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/">Lighthouse</a> gets it juuuuuust right. In order to migrate my tickets I wrote a <a href="http://github.com/loe/lighthouse-bugzilla-importer/tree/master">little script to parse Bugzilla XML and create and post Lighthouse tickets</a>. The code is up on <a href="http://github.com/loe/lighthouse-bugzilla-importer/tree/master">github</a>.
