title: Navy Fall
---
October 14-15 @ Navy in FJs & 420s<br />
A: Erik Storck/Killarney Loufek & Andrew Geffken<br />
B: Andrew Loe/Betsy Bryant

Saturday: Shifty and Variable conditions, we sailed pretty well, but were inconsistent off the starting line, finished the day close to the top of B.

Sunday: We were fast. Really fast. Two 4s, a second and five 1st place races. Reminded me how valuable boatspeed is. We could do what we wanted, when we wanted. 

Its always fun when you win by a lot, hopefully we can keep going the way we have been!
