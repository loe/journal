title: Rails is on Git!

<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2008/4/2/rails-is-moving-from-svn-to-git">Rails is moving from SVN to Git</a>!

I have not yet patched <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a>, but I am still very excited about the move to <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a>. Why? I think it will spawn some cool forks that solve special cases. These branches (especially with the social nature of <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>) will be much easier to find and develop. Its a good day in the rails community.
