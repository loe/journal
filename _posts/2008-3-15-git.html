I've been experimenting with <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> for source control management (SCM), I'm really starting to appreciate the benefits of the distributed features it provides. The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">User's Manual</a> is very comprehensive, and the <a href="http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html">SVN -> Git crash course</a> was excellent in getting me up to speed. <a href="http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/">Simplistic Complexity</a> provides an awesome <a href="http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/2008/03/05/cleanly-migrate-your-subversion-repository-to-a-git-repository/">SVN to Git Migration Guide</a> that helped me split my monolithic subversion repository into a series of lean git trees. Although git is relatively new, there is some pretty good support for hooking it into existing tools like <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a>, which has support for git in its latest trunk. Hopefully I will be able to convert some of my co-workers soon, but until then I'm going to be using a <a href="http://andy.delcambre.com/2008/3/4/git-svn-workflow">hybrid workflow of git and subversion</a>, mostly facilitated by git-svn.

Update:
I've been playing with <a href="http://eagain.net/gitweb/?p=gitosis.git;a=summary">gitosis</a> for managing "push" repositories that I can share with others or use to deploy with <a href="http://www.capify.org/">capistrano</a>. The program requires you have <a href="http://kimmo.suominen.com/docs/ssh/">SSH setup</a> perfectly, and there are a few caveats (read: must use ssh on port 22 to deploy with capistrano), but its very simple once you <a href="http://scie.nti.st/2007/11/14/hosting-git-repositories-the-easy-and-secure-way">get it working</a>. I really like how access to your repositories is done with public SSH keys. <a href="http://scie.nti.st/2007/11/14/hosting-git-repositories-the-easy-and-secure-way">Scie.nti.st</a> has more.

Another Update:
I secured a <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> beta invite and was able to successfully push all of my repositories there. <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> also has some great documentation on <a href="http://github.com/guides/deploying-with-capistrano">deploying with capistrano and github</a> which enabled me to re-deploy all of my applications to my server using git. As a side-benefit I now also have all my <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">mongrels</a> running as an unprivileged user.
