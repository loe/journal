title: Awesome Sailing Site
---
So I've started coding a really sweet news site for sailing. I think that one doesn't exist, but it should. This site is going to have lots of great features, and initially target college sailors, and then expand to juniors and finally to PHRF and those slow adults. Hopefully it'll have a huge staff when the 2007 AC comes around :).
