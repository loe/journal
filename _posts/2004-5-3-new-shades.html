I got to pick-up my new shades today. They're <a href="http://www.kaenon.com/product.cfm?action=show_product&product_id=579&style1=2&style2=4&style3=0&preview=yes&CFID=1303477&CFTOKEN=89437737">UPDs</a> from <a href="http://www.kaenon.com/">Kaenon</a>. I already had a similar pair but I thought they were lost - until they were found and given to me this weekend at New Englands. Apparently they had fallen off my head behind the couch at the house we were staying at during the Friis Trophy... I may or may not have been SLIGHTLY.. uhhh.... <a href="http://www.millerbrewing.com/">inebriated</a>.. :) This is my third pair of <a href="http://www.kaenon.com/">Kaenon</a>s, I also have a pair of <a href="http://www.kaenon.com/product.cfm?action=show_product&product_id=577&style1=2&style2=4&style3=0&preview=yes&CFID=1303477&CFTOKEN=89437737">Kurbs</a>.
