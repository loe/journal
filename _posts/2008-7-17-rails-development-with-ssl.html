title: Rails Development with SSL
---
## Big Picture

"Nginx":http://nginx.net/ will accept connection on ports 80 (http) and https (443). Under SSL/TLS nginx will negotiate the encryption and proxy any requests that it cannot serve to our trusty "mongrel":http://mongrel.rubyforge.com/ running on port 3000. Mongrel doesn't handle encrypted traffic, instead we pass a flag (X_FORWARDED_PROTO) that indicates the request came over SSL.

## Prerequisites

You will need a functioning "Macports":http://macports.com/ installation and a functioning development environment (i.e. you can browse your project at localhost:3000).

## Conventions

`$` indicates a standard shell prompt.<br />
`#` indicates the command needs to be run as the root user by assuming root privileges with `sudo`.

### Install nginx with SSL Support

`# port install nginx +ssl`

### Make Your Certs Directory

`# mkdir -p /opt/local/etc/nginx/certs`<br />
`$ cd /opt/local/etc/nginx/certs`

### Make Your Own Certificate

Follow the prompts but **MAKE SURE TO USE *.example.com AS YOUR Common Name!**<br />
"http://pastie.org/234929":http://pastie.org/234929<br/>
`# openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 365 -out server.crt -keyout server.key`

### Create an nginx Configuration File

Use "http://pastie.org/234927":http://pastie.org/234927 as an example.<br/>
Edit out my locations with yours. (i.e. Replace /Users/Andrew/Projects/macchiato with wherever your code lives.)<br />
`# mate /opt/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

### Fire Up nginx and Your Mongrel

`# /opt/local/sbin/nginx`<br/>
`$ script/server`

### Check Your DNS

`# mate /etc/hosts to make sure app.example.com points to localhost`

### Accept Your New Certificate

Open https://app.example.com/ in Safari. Select Show Certificate and accept it permanently.<br />
In Firefox you will have to manually import your certificate.<br />
Firefox => Preferences => Advanced => Encryption => View Certificates => Authorities => Import => /opt/local/etc/nginx/certs/server.crt => Make sure Trust this CA to identify web sites is checked => Ok.
