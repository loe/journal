<a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> has released a <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">new toy</a> called <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>. Like almost every Google product its still in Beta, but its usable. The site is getting hammered pretty hard right now, but it should speed up as the issues become apparent. The interface is all Ajaxy and quite clean. Features are lacking, but they're sure to come, its only been out for about an hour!
