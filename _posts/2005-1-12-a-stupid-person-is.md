title: A Stupid Person Is...
---
* A few clowns short of a circus...
* A few fries short of a Happy Meal...
* An experiment in artificial stupidity
* A few beers short of a six pack
* Dumber than a box of hair
* Doesn't have all his Cornflakes in one box
* The wheel's spinning but the hamster's dead
* One taco short of a combo platter
* All foam, no beer
* The cheese slid off his cracker
* Body by Fisher, brains by Mattel
* Has an IQ of 2, but it takes 3 to grunt
* Couldn't pour water out of a boot with instructions on the heel
* He fell out of the Stupid Tree and hit every branch on the way down
* An intellect rivaled only by garden tools
* As smart as bait
* Chimney's clogged
* Elevator doesn't go all the way to the top floor
* Forgot to pay his brain bill
* Her sewing machine's out of thread
* His antenna doesn't pick up all the channels
* His belt doesn't go through all the loops
* If he had another brain, it would be lonely
* Missing a few buttons on his remote control
* No grain in the silo
* Proof that evolution can go in reverse
* Receiver is off the hook
* Slinky's kinked
* Too much yardage between the goal posts
* Not the sharpest knife in the drawer
* Half a bubble off plumb
* A few sandwiches short of a picnic
