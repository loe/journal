Summer is here in Seattle. Mallory and I took full advantage of it last week and took our fancy picnic basket (thanks Mom!) and some tasty treats to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=volunteer+park,+seattle,+wa&ie=UTF8&ll=47.631749,-122.313902&spn=0.010874,0.018153&z=16">Volunteer Park</a>. <!-- We took some pictures of our <a href="http://gallery.andrewloe.com/view/life/picnic-in-volunteer-park/">Picnic in Volunteer Park</a>.
