title: Amp & Sub
---
Recently I was given a 12" Alpine Sub woofer in a sealed box, and a 250 Watt Amp to power it. Well on Friday I took my entire interior apart and got it installed. Its awesome. My truck is pretty loud on the road because its got wide tires and its old - but with a solid stereo I can turn up the volume and it doesn't bother me at all. Since my door speakers are pretty small (to fit in the original mounts) - there was a pretty obvious lack of bass that no equalizer could fix. With the sub and amp all setup - it rocks. So if you want to bump to 50, it sounds just as hot as the dance club. Big Up yourself - respek.
