The <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod nano</a> was unveiled today, as well as <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes 5</a> and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/">Motorola Rokr</a>. Cool stuff, but I'll stick with my <a href="http://direct.motorola.com/ENS/Web_ProductHome.asp?country=USA&language=ENS&productid=29690">black Motorola RAZR</a> and 20GB 3G<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> (thanks Mom!).
