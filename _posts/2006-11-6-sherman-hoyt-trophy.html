October 21-22 @ Brown in 420s<br />
A: Erik Storck/K. Loufek & Jimmy Attridge<br />
B: Andrew Loe/Betsy Bryant & Ben Bier & Killarney Loufek

Saturday: 10-15, with a stint of 18-20. Trying conditions for me personally, having rough time starting (either over or 2nd row) and baffled by the shifts. Not a good day.

Sunday: Never got a consistent breeze direction, but much better sailing on my part. Put up 2 top 5s and a top 10, defiantly felt some redemption.

Proved to myself that I can bounce back, something that will probably come in to play at an important event in the spring. Though we didn't sail particularly well, we tied (though lost) the ACC berth. A disappointing 8th in B. Guess we can't rage at the Schell!
