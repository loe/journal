title: Things To Do
---
I've decided there are some things that I want to be better at. In no specific order: Skateboarding, I've always been OK but I can't do any of the cooler tricks (read: 360 flip), now that I'm on break in a warm climate I should take advantage of it. Guitar, I am pretty good on the Piano, but there is something about the sound of the guitar that draws me, I'd just like to be decent enough to cover most songs I listen too. I am also working on a collage of everything I do, maybe work it into a layout for this site if I magically get creative overnight (one can always dream, no?). Respekt.
