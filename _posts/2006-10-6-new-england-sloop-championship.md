Saturday: South West breeze is very shifty, which made for some strange sailing in keel boats. We never got comfortable upwind, but made big moves downwind. Starting defiantly improved as we got the timing down.

Sunday: Same theme as saturday, we were more patient and won a race, but got passed in the following race using almost the same approach.

Shifty conditions made for some tough calls, tacking is so slow you had to choose which shifts were worthy, and which were not. We did not make good calls here and didn't have the upwind speed to compete with the top three boats.

4th, beat the "rest" but didn't have the upwind speed to compete with the top three for a Nationals berth.
