September 30-October 1 @ Coast Guard in FJs & 420s<br />
A: Erik Storck/Killarney Loufek<br />
B: Andrew Loe/Betsy Bryant

Saturday: Started off hot, then breeze went to the South East/West/North and things got crazy.

Sunday: Crazy storms, then no wind. 1 bogus race.

Tough to really learn anything when conditions were virtually a free for all. Defiantly need to continue to get more consistent with our starts. OCS killed us, finished 6th in B, but feel like we did better - yet still frustrated with conditions.

Back to Coast Guard again for third weekend in a row! All three kinds of college sailing in one venue in back-to-back weekends, pretty fun.
