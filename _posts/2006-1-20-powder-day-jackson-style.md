<p>Nucci and I got up to Jackson Hole Mountain Resort at around 11 after sleeping in. We rode the Gondola to the top  and then hiked Stairway to Heaven (Elevator Shaft) to the top of the Headwall. From here we had our choice of excellent routes: Headwall, Casper Bowl, or the Crags. On Nucci's advice, we hiked North (skier's left) to the Crags and dropped in. <a href="http://andrewloe.com/gallery/view/snowboarding/2006-01-20/">We took a few photos on the way down.</a></p>
