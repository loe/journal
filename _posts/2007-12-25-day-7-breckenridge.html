title: "Day 7: Breckenridge"
---
We finished our amazing trip with a stop in <a href="breckenridge.snow.com/">Breckenridge</a>. It was a bit crowded with all of the holiday day-skiers, but we had a good time in the park and on the groomers. We get home just in time for the holidays, with the rest of the family already waiting.
