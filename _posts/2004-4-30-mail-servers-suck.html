title: Mail Servers Suck
---
Why can't there be an easily configured mail server? Instead I have to follow an 18 step "tutorial" where I have NO idea what is going on just to startup <a href="http://www.qmail.org/">qmail</a> server with IMAP access. Stupid. In the process I learned that I still am a moron and I managed to delete /etc/courier before "purging" the packages, that really pissed off dkpg and if it hadn't been for some handy work by <a href="http://www.wuputah.com/">JD</a> I would still be fighting the system. Gh3y. I need to sleep - much sailing to be done tomorrow.

EDIT - I'm <a href="http://www.qmailrocks.org/">qmailrocks.org's <a href="http://www.qmailrocks.net/install_db.htm">qmail toaster for Debian</a>. Its pretty good - about half of it uses Debian Packages.</a>
