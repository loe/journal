title: Cake PHP framework
---
<a href="http://sputnik.pl/cake/">Cake PHP framework</a>, is a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> clone for <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>. I haven't had the chance to try it myself, but it looks very promising for rapid development of sites.
