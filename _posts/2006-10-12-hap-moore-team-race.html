Saturday: First team race regatta in a long time! We sailed well, only losing races in some questionable situations. Definatly solidified ourselves as one of the top teams to beat, but also one of the most fun teams to race against.

Sunday: Started the day with a frustrating loss in zero wind. The race should have been called but the comittee was interested in completing the rotation to guarantee a regatta if it turned out the wind was done for the day. Wind filled later in the afternoon and we were able to complete a full top 6 rotation. We went undefeated, surviving a battle with St. Mary's. Definatly feel vindicated by sweeping the final round. Our communication got much better, and I knocked off a lot of rust - the stupid mistakes were much less common in the last round-robin.

Overall: 2nd place ain't too shabby. No one is going to win team race nationals in the fall.
