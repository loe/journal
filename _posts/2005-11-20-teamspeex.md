After all the excitement over <a href="http://ventrilo.com/">Ventrilo</a> release for OS X I remembered that their public server version has a hard coded limit of 8 users. They essentially force you to rent a server to do anything useful! Luckily though, I came across <a href="http://www.savvy.nl/blog/">TeamSpeex</a>, an OS X client for <a href="http://goteamspeak.com/">Teamspeak</a> without the stupid limit on its public server! So I will be setting up a Teamspeak server on this machine, and I will keep the Ventrilo client installed for when I need it.
