Well since I hate spammers, and I have the resources to help out, I've donated an MX entry, and have signed up to become a part of <a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org?rf=40253">Project Honey Pot</a>. Its a well thought out, and unique way to help catch spammers - it sure as hell can't hurt. So join up!
