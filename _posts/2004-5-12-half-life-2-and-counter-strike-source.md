title: Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike Source
---
The E3 2004 Trailer for HL2 is out! Check it out <a href="/files/media/hl2_e32k4_trailer.mov">here</a>.
The other very cool thing is that Counter-Strike will be released on the Source Engine with the release of Half-Life 2. <a href="http://www.csnation.net/">CS Nation</a> has a really good <a href="http://www.csnation.net/viewnews.php/7157/">preview</a> of the release which is expected to come out tonight.
