title: Site Specific Browsers (SSBs)
---
I just spent a few minute setting up Site Specific Browsers for my <a href="http://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a>. Using <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a>, which was inspired by <a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>'s <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/">Prism</a>, and some nice icons left me with a pretty cool setup - little red badges even show up on my icons if I have unread mail or feed items.
