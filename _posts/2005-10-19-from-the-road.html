I'm on my way up to Illinois for a wedding this weekend. Right now I'm posting from somewhere on Interstate 57 near the Missouri/Illinois border. GPRS over Bluetooth rocks. The connection is about as good as a 56k modem, plenty enough to get the <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/">latest news on the hurricane</a>.
