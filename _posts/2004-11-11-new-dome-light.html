title: New Dome Light
---
I'm very proud of my self right now. I just made my first repair to my truck. The switch on the dome light was beginning to fail, so I took it apart, replaced the broken piece and it works perfectly... yay me!

Left to fix:
Rear U-Joints
Passenger Rear Door Actuator (to turn on that shiny new dome light!)
Rear Passenger Shock Adjuster

To buy:
ARB Front Bumper
IPF Driving Lights & Headlights
Warn 12K winch
Full-Float rear axle
FJZ80 E-Lockers (hence the FF rear axle)
....
..
.

One day. Its a fun project.
