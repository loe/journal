---
U.S. coverage of the Louis Vuitton Cup Semi-Finals is on <a href="http://www.versus.com/americascup">Versus</a>, the network formerly known as OLN. There is also excellent web coverage lead by <a href="http://sail.tv/">sail.tv</a>. As it stands now, <a href="http://www.emiratesteamnz.com/">Emirates Team New Zealand</a> is up 2-1 over <a href="http://www.desafioespanol2007.com/">Desafío Español</a> in Semi-Final A. In Semi-Final B, it is <a href="http://www.lunarossachallenge.com/">Luna Rossa</a> over <a href="http://http://www.bmworacleracing.com/">BMW Oracle Racing</a> 2-1. Both series are a best of 9 races, there is plenty more sailing to be done. Tomorrow is a lay-day, the perfect opportunity to catch up on the action (Race 2 between Luna Rossa and BMW Oracle is the best so far!).
