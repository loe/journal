title: The Legend of Zelda
---
E3 is this week/end and I am a huge game fan myself. One of my favorite series of all time is the The Legend of Zelda. My favorite is the Ocarina of Time for N64. but I have enjoyed every title I played dating back to 8-bit Nintentdo. I have yet to play the Wind Waker as I cannot get my hands on a GameCube. But I plan to complete it this summer. <!-- Check out the movie <a href="/files/media/e3_2004_zelda.mov">here</a>.
