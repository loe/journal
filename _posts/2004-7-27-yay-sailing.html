title: Yay! Sailing!
---
Looks like I'll finally get to do some of the sailing I wanted to do this summer. This weekend I'm planning on sailing some <a href="http://www.laser.org/m/_general/default.asp">Laser</a> sailing this weekend in Hyannis, MA and then hopefully I'll sail <a href="http://www.buzzardsbayregatta.com/">BBR (Buzzards Bay Regatta)</a> the following weekend in <a href="http://www.v15.org/">V-15</a>s.

Wish me luck and for watch for results!
