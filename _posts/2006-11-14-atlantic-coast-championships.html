title: Atlantic Coast Championships
---
November 11-12 @ Brown in 420s<br />
A: Erik Storck/Killarney Loufek & Jimmy Attridge<br />
B: Andrew Loe/Betsy Bryant & Matthew Cohen

Saturday: Light morning that filled in to a nice southerly. Had good speed all day, just made some positioning errors that cost us some points. Watch for Moorings!

Sunday: Crushing speed in the very light conditions.

We won, by 29, a lot. Erik crushed A and I was a close second in B. A great close to the season, both Erik & Killarney, and Betsy and I were finally able to sail well at the same time.
