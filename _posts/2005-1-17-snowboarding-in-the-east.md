title: Snowboarding in the east
---
No matter what anyone tells you - its vastly inferior to anything out west. Since it got to almost 60 on Thursday, everything melted and then re-froze, making EVERY SLOPE A GIANT ICE RINK. Amazing. Hopefully the temperatures will stabilize and we'll get some snow so it can be groomed down and a base can get started. Right now the parks are virtually unridable because they're so frozen - the run for the medium sized park (my level!) hasn't even opened yet! Maybe I can win the lottery and take a trip out to Whistler for a week? Sure...

BUT

Snowboarding is just like sex, even if its bad - its still pretty damn good!
