Well I've never been much of a baseball fan, but there is something about the <a href="http://redsox.com/">Red Sox</a> that has just sucked me in. They're going to break the curse of the Bambino and the entire town is going to revel in a huge party for an entire year - I think I'm going to go to some Boston bars for the final games.
