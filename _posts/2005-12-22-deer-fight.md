I said I'd say more about the incident with the deer... The night I drove into Jackson it was snowing pretty hard, and like most winter nights - it was DARK. I was driving at a safe speed for a well trafficked highway (~ 40 mph in 4wd), but didn't take into consideration wildlife. The road has a "gutter" if you can call it that, about 5 deer (I know this after the fact) were standing there waiting for some nice bright lights to cross in. Land Cruiser 1, Deer 0.
