I got my hands on a <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a> account. Its pretty cool, but it won't become my main email client. I think its best to stick to standards when it comes to communication mediums. I like knowing I can check my email at any location any time because my mail is fully compliant with POP, IMAP and SMTP.
