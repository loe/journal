After a tough search, I finally found <a href="http://gallery.andrewloe.com/view/life/718-10th-ave-east/">an apartment</a> I really like. The rent is reasonable, and the place is HUGE! I have covered parking out back, with a back door entrance that is only a few feet from my parking space. Inside are beautiful hardwood floors, cool and funky details, and great lighting. The front window faces the west, so the whole apartment, especially the main room, are full of afternoon and evening light.
