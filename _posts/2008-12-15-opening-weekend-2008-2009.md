title: Opening Weekend 2008/2009
---
It has been a bit of a late start to the season here in Washington, but we finally got a big system that dropped nearly two feet on the resorts. <a href="http://www.skicrystal.com/">Crystal Mountain</a> opened on Saturday morning, and we took advantage of the good early season conditions. I went back up on Sunday with some co-workers and was lucky enough to get some pow turns in December! It was a great start to the season.
