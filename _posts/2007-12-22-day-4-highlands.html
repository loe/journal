title: "Day 4: Highlands"
---
Our predictions were spot on for the day. We got to <a href="http://www.aspensnowmass.com/">Aspen Highlands</a> right at 9 in the morning. After a warm up and a few runs on upper mountain, ski patrol opened the Highland Bowl at 11. With no line for the snow cat (which saves you from a pretty tough hike) and no crowd, we were able to lap the bowl until we couldn't walk. The pictures say it all. Powder!
