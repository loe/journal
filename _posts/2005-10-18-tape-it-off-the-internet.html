title: Tape It Off The Internet
---
<a href="http://tapeitofftheinternet.com/">Tape It Off The Internet</a> is like an <a href="http://odeo.com/">Odeo</a> for TV. They don't have anything out yet, but its a great idea and <a href="http://neuromantics.net/">the company behind it</a> certainly has the resources and expertise to pull it off. I hope someone who does it right (like Odeo!) will expand into the other markets and become a great media portal. Or even better, the APIs for these different sites become so well done that users can synthesize their own media portals! Hrmmm... good idea.
