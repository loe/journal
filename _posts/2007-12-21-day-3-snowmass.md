title: "Day 3: Snowmass"
---
After sleeping in a bit, we mosied up to Snowmass for a lazy day. This is the first week of the season for both of us, so our legs are still pretty weak. In the morning we found a few stashes in the Big Burn glades. Around mid-day it started lightly snowing, so we continued our search for stashes on Elk Camp, eventually settling on the more sheltered Alpine Springs. At around 2:30 we called it a day, and we are getting psyched up to hit <a href="http://www.aspensnowmass.com/">Aspen Highlands</a>. New snow tomorrow, combined with the snow we received today should add up to an excellent day.
