title: The Web 2.0

Oh yeah, buzzwords. I wanted to give my two cents on the "new web."

I like.

Seriously, there are all these amazing new frameworks coming out, all with great user-bases and support. The only language I'm really waiting on is PHP. I could roll my own, but then I wouldn't get the help of having a whole community behind my project. When <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> gets a cool new feature, I get it too. When I write one (one day), everyone will get to benefit. Open source is pretty slick. Besides RoR, there are plenty of frameworks, all of which I've checked out, but I think I'm going to stick with RoR, I especially like its integration with the <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a> javascript library.

Ruby:
<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a>

Python:
<a href="http://www.turbogears.com/">TurboGears</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a><br/>

PHP:
<a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.mojavi.org/">Mojavi</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.phpwact.org/">WACT</a><br/>

Almost all of these frameworks are Model View Controller, which seems to be the preferred pattern for web applications. No need to re-invent the wheel, go with the proven method. Please comment if you know of any other frameworks, I'm always on the look out for good stuff.
