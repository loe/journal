title: What do I do?
---
I am freaking out. I can't deal. I don't know whats going on. So I'll post here...... I have one more answer for my take home History exam and then I'm done. But I can't write it. I know what to write, I have an outline. I even have notes on each point in my outline. I can't type it up though. I just can't make myself do it. DO IT. DOO IT. Wow. So when you are in the situation what do you do? I can't even think about what I should do.
