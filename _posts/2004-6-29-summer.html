title: Summer!
---
Well I'm back at <a href="http://dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth</a> for the summer. Its going to be a great term with a lot of crazy events coming up (Tubestock!?). Looking to do some team racing this summer as well, currently signed up for the Falmouth regatta on the 10th and the 11th which will be a good time. I'll probably also do BBR and the other events this summer.
