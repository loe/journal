title: Thompson Trophy

April 21-22 @ CGA in FJs & 420s<br />
A: Erik Storck/Killarney Loufek
B: Andrew Loe/Matthew Cohen

Saturday: We showed up to a dying Northerly with high hopes for a good sea-breeze. Unfortunately we ended up with the two breezes fighting throughout the day. Matty and I started off rough, but we got ourselves sorted and started to figure things out. Only 7 races.

Sunday: Light. We continued our surge up the ranks and got as high as second in B before tanking the last set. Good bounce-back from a deep standing. Erik and Killarney sailed brilliantly to win A by a considerable margin. As a team we were up more than 40 points going into the last set. Even with our poor final set we still won the regatta by 18 and re-estabilshed ourselves.

Tied for 4th, not bad after starting with an 18, 9.
