title: Life on the Mama Doll
---
<a href="http://mamadoll.tv/">Life on the Mama Doll</a> is my father's newest project. It's a TV show centered around the Biloxi Lugger _Mama Doll_. In the teaser video he sums up the nature of the show: "Life on the Mama Doll is really about exploring the gulf coast with great friends, fantastic chefs, and good local guides so we can always catch some fish." 

The footage came out very well, and the editing is top notch. <a href="http://mamadoll.tv/">Give it a look</a>.
