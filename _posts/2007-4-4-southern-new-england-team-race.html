Saturday:  Sailing didn't get started until around 11:30 when the southerly filled in. We went 6-1 in the first round, only losing to Harvard. We sailed a few races in the afternoon, but they wouldn't end up counting. Down-speed boat handling was atrocious, but had good starts.

Sunday: Frustrating. We went 4-3 dropping races for tons of different things, all relating to a lack of communication. My boat handling improved but team and boat communication did not.

4th. Disappointing, but its the first I've sailed in nearly 4 months. As a team we need to get on the same page, which can only happen if we start talking more. Too many times we would be working hard at the wrong thing. Its early, but we need to get on these things early.
