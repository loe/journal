title: W. Andrew Loe III
---
Who am I? William Andrew Loe One. Two. Three.

I'm the third William Andrew Loe, descending from the second, William A. Loe Jr., M.D., F.A.C.S. and more letters that I can't think of right now, and the first: William Andrew Loe (aka Bill/Grandy). Why do I go by Andrew instead of William? Two reasons. Primarily, my mother wanted to name a child Andrew, it just so happens that she lucked out and married a Jr. with that name. Second, Bill and Will were already taken by #1 and #2, so it was inevitable.

School: I'm a recent graduate of <a href="http://dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a>.

Sports: I like to sail. I'm also pretty good at it, but if you're reading this site you probably already know that story. I'm also very big into snowboarding, enough to move to Wyoming to practice this fine art for an entire winter.

Nerdery: I like computers and spend way too much time programming and playing games. This site is a product of that passion. Most of my focus in the programming arena surrounds internet technologies. I'm into all the current buzzwords: Web 2.0, AJAX, Ruby on Rails, Less is More etc. I also like video games. Most recently I've been playing <a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a>. In the past I have been a very strong <a href="http://counter-strike.net/">Counter-Strike</a> player, as well as a respectable <a href="http://www.planettribes.com/">Tribes</a> player.

Work: I am currently a full-time <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> developer for <a href="http://www.onehub.com/">Onehub.com</a> in Seattle, WA.
