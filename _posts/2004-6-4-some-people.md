title: Some People...
---
Why do some people just not understand how to work in a library? Its been years since the cell phone was invented - they <strong>ALL</strong> let you disable the ringer - yet some people still have their phones ring in the utter silence of the stack annexes. Its annoying.

Spanish tomorrow. Psych was today. Test went alright but I could have studied more for the cumulative part. I rocked the 4th hour test though (3 tests during the term and the 4th combined with the final were this morning.) - a nice change from the last two.

I'll write up a full report on the Nationals in the coming days. I'm still digesting what happened.

For now, its all about Spanish Literature. My final class in the Dartmouth Language Requirement - atleast after this I'll finally be done with <strong>something</strong>, a welcomed relief. This is the first time I've taken a second class in a department, maybe I should declare it my major....
