title: Tweaking Gmail Notifier
---
After doing some reading I learned a few tricks about <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/index?promo=gdl-en">Gmail Notifier</a>. First, there is a <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> <a href="http://www.wootest.net/gmailgrowl/">plugin that will display a notification</a> when new mail comes in. The other cool idea comes from the author of <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~natan/gcount/">gCount</a>, he has changed the icons of the Google notifier to match his icons, which I agree look much better. If you like you can also use the icons from <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/carsten.guenther/GmailStatus/">GmailStatus</a>. Good stuff.
