title: "The Power Of Social Networking: Last.fm Gets It Right"
---
While tinkering away with <a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com/">Evan Weaver</a>'s <a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com/files/doc/fauna/sweeper">sweeper</a> (a ruby gem for updating id3 tags of mp3s based off <a href="http://last.fm/">last.fm</a>'s fingerprint database) I started clicking around <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/WALoeIII/">my last.fm profile</a>. I've been a religious <a href="http://www.last.fm/help/faq/?category=The+Service#321">scrobbler</a> for a few years now (nearly 20,000 songs since May 4th, 2004), but I had never stopped to think about how powerful all of this data could be. I mostly used last.fm for its music recommendations; <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/WALoeIII/">my profile</a> page will suggest artists for me to explore based off what I have listened to in the past.

Today, I discovered an even cooler feature: <a href="http://www.last.fm/events">events</a>. Last.fm knows what I like, and it knows about lots of events (concerts, shows, festivals). By combining this data, the service can build me a <a href="http://30boxes.com/external/widget?refer=ff&url=webcal%3A%2F%2Fws.audioscrobbler.com%2F1.0%2Fuser%2FWALoeIII%2Feventsysrecs.ics">custom calendar of upcoming acts that I may be interested in</a>! I've created a quick mash-up using <a href="http://30boxes.com/">30 boxes</a> iCal support to display the information on the web, but I have already added this calendar to my personal google calendar. Now, even as my music tastes change, and I move around, I will always have calendar of upcoming events in my area that I will likely be interested in attending. It makes even more sense that <a href="http://blog.last.fm/2007/05/30/lastfm-acquired-by-cbs">CBS spent big money to acquire</a> these guys.
