title: Stereo!

I got a stereo all setup and configured in the FJ60. It a <a href="http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/pna/product/detail/0,,2076_4041_64485116,00.html">Pioneer (Premier) HU</a>, with basic<a href="http://sonystyle.com/">Sony</a> speakers, two-way in the backs and three-ways on the front doors. I've got a <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?productLearnMore=T6715LL/A">Belkin Auto Charger</a> that plugs into my <a href="http://apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a>. This<a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?productLearnMore=T6715LL/A">charger</a> also plugs into the Multi-CD changer on the HU via an RCA to mini adapter, so I have great sound. The HU is extremely basic but its everything I need. 50W x 4 and Subwoofer support. In the fall when the iPod interface is released by Pioneer I'll upgrade from the Belkin and have the HU read the song titles and playlists. For now though, I can listen to my iPod on the road without having to use a tape adapter or stupid <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?productLearnMore=T7194LL/A">FM transmitter</a>.
