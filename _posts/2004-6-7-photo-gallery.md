title: Photo Gallery!
---
Well since I can't study right now I figured I should do something productive, so I created a <a href="http://gallery.andrewloe.com/">Photo Gallery</a>. This was done with a sweet application called <a href="http://gallery.sf.net/">Gallery</a> which is done in PHP. To make the whole package even sweeter I'm using an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> <a href="http://zwily.com/iphoto/">plugin</a> called <a href="http://zwily.com/iphoto/">iPhotoToGallery</a> to export directly to my <a href="http://gallery.andrewloe.com/">Gallery</a> installation. The whole system is VERY slick and I hope to post more photos once I get a camera of my own. That is all for now, back to the History Exam.
