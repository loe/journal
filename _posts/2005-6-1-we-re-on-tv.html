<!-- As we get ready to head out for the <a href="http://collegesailing.org/nas/spring05/">Nationals</a>, the Burlington, VT news station came down to <a href="http://andrewloe.com/public/sailing/dartmouth_sailing_news.mpg">interview</a> Todd, Clementine, and Brian.

The file is MPEG-2, so you'll need a media player that can handle that format. I suggest <a href="http://videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>, but there are many other alternatives.
