Spring Break week was spent sailing at Charleston. We enjoyed great practice, with only one morning where there wasn't enough wind to sail. Charleston team was kinda lame, they typically host a fun party on Thursday night, but that fell through - maybe next year. We know we've got some work to do in team racing, I think most of those problems will be solvable once we are practicing on Mascoma (WHICH IS STILL FROZEN, WOW.).
