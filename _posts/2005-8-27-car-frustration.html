title: Car Frustration
---
Turns out some pretty shady stuff has been done to the engine of my truck. Right now its at a specialty shop, and the guy sounded like he was about to hurl in disgust while talking to me on the phone. At least it will all be fixed now! 

While I'm carless, I'm hanging out in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oi=map&q=Providence,+RI">Providence, RI</a>, so if you have any ideas or fun things to do please drop me a line!
