I just setup <a href="http://www.torrentflux.com/">TorrentFlux</a> on my server! This has to be one of the coolest scripts I have ever seen! It downloads files for you from a web server and then I can connect to my server and download them off my personal FTP. This is better because it doesn't require me to use my outgoing bandwidth on my machine which slows it down. I also get faster downloads because I my server has a much better upload then I do, and download is proportional to upload speed. I can also use this system to seed new files.
