<a href="http://steadmanband.com/">Steadman</a> is a British band that has twice been signed to major label deals. Unfortunately both of those deals imploded. Fortunately for the world, they have have gone "indie" and have released their <a href="http://steadmanband.com/main.html">entire catalog online</a>. I've been listening to them this evening and its very good stuff - maybe I'll post a proper review later in the week? Nope.
