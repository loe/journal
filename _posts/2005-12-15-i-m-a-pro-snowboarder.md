title: I'm a Pro Snowboarder
---
I completed all my instructor training today. I'm officially a professional snowboard instructor. I'm going to be teaching kids 7-14. I'm pretty psyched to get the kids at this age. "Explorers" are capable of spending a whole day in the snow, but they don't yet have egos or the other issues that come with most teenagers. Should be a fun winter! Small park opens on Saturday, fun fun.
