Nothing much going on in Hanover. I watched <a href="http://collateral-themovie.com/">Collateral</a> which was entertaining, but nothing to write home about. Lately, I've been really into music, expanding my horizons. <a href="http://thedoors.com/">The Doors</a> have been the band of choice, and some random R&B groups that I've heard about as well. Yeah.
