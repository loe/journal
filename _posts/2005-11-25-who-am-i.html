title: Who Am I?
---
I put up a quick <a href="http://journal.andrewloe.com/about">about page</a>. Ironically it does exactly what you would think it does, details a bit about who I am and what I do. I thought about calling it a collophon since apparently thats a more appropriate name, but recalled an old proverb from High School English: "never use a big word when a small word will suffice."
