title: Zombie Simulation
---
The <a href="http://www.sothisisacomic.com/Zombie/zomb3.html">Zombie Simulation</a> is pretty self explanitory. Its a simulation of what would happen to a small city if it were infested with zombies. The whole thing is configurable, you can enable soldiers to shoot them and watch the zombie population kept under control, or you can try droping bombs, or just let them run wild!
