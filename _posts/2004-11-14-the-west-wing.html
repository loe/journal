title: The West Wing
---
While I'm on the random topics: The West Wing is awesome. Even as a Republican. I first got hooked on this show hanging out with my mom, and its followed me since I've "moved on." (Hi MOM! =]) Anyways, CJ Craig is now the White House Chief of Staff, and the show has reached a new level for me, the only person on the show that I never really liked was Leo. I guess some parts of me also loved to hate him though.
