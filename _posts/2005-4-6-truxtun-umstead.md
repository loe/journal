Saturday - Pretty light, only got two races in, Elisabeth and I were sailing B, Storck and Clementine were in A. For Lasers and Radials, Wilde was sailing C and Fleming and Luke sailed D. Nothing exciting, E and I got a kinetics penalty for sculling to the side to avoid a collision around the leeward mark... ghey. Saturday night Kreter got Debola, a wonderful 24 hr. bug that Debbie brought back from the reservation - 10 people ended up getting it, thankfully I was not one of them. Sunday I sailed the first set with Kreter, but she was feeling so ill that Killarney got dressed and sailed. She had just gotten back into the country from Spain, and was pretty jet lagged, but sailed very well. Sunday was frustrating, we were so close to breaking into the top of every race, but had trouble with small things, that kept pushing us back to mid-fleet. We finished virtually every race in 5th-10th. Finished 8th in B, 7th overall.
