October 28-29 @ MIT in Techs & FJs<br />
A: Erik Storck/Killarney Loufek & Ben Sampson & Anne Megargel<br />
B: Andrew Loe/Betsy Bryant & Anne Megargel & Adele Wilhelm

Saturday: Moderate conditions on the Charles. Nothing special, except I sailed past the finish in top 5 and ended up with a 17... dumbass.

Sunday: Windy. Like really windy. Blowing the hair off the balls off the dog off the chain windy. Puffs in the 50s, sustained 30-35. Majority of the day was sailed in Techs with storm-sails. For fun, FJs came out for one race, entertaining to watch.

Probably circumstances I'll never have to sail in again, but hey, its the river. Sailing was great, focus was off. Too many stupid mistakes. Opposite of Brown, but with a week to clear my head, I should be good to go for ACCs. 4th in B.
