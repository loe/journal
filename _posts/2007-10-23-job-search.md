So I'm on the hunt for my first job. Its supposed to be fun, its supposed to be exciting - it sucks. I have no idea what I want to do! I can eliminate tons of things - I don't want to peel shrimp, I don't want to tune pianos, I don't want to be shot at - but eliminating all these things just seems to open new options in different directions. Wasn't I supposed to get all of this out of the way in college? To "discover" myself? I feel more lost then I was when I started the whole process. To make matters more frustrating, I still have a part of me that wants to move back to a big white mountain, but I feel somewhat obligated to follow the social norms: birth, school, job, death... taxes? There is so much I want to do, I just don't know where I'm supposed to start. Maybe I should just team up with the guys that make Dr. Pepper... I could drink this stuff all day.
