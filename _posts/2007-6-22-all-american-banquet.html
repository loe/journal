title: All-American Banquet
---
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth</a> was well represented at the All-American Banquet. We had 5 full All-Americans. Betsy Bryant, Killarney Loufek, and Kate Hacker were all honored as crew All-Americans. Erik Storck and I were both named as All-American Skippers! Besides the strong showing from Dartmouth, it was amazing to stand in front of everyone with my brother John. He had an excellent year leading the <a href="http://www.smcm.edu/">St. Mary's Seahawks</a> to a National Championship.
