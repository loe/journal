September 9-10 @ Dartmouth in FJs<br />
A: Andrew Loe/Betsy Bryant<br />
B: Jimmy Attridge/Kate Hacker

Saturday: No sailing.

Sunday: North/NE wind was kind of an unusual direction, learned a lot about when to be patient, and when to make things happen. Had some good starts, and had some awful starts - defiantly need to be more consistent there.

6th in A, great learning experience.
