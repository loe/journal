I have started to use iCal to organize my life and found <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> has a really cool <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical/library/">library</a> of calendars that can be subscribed to. I just signed up for <a href="http://ical.mac.com/ical/US32Holidays.ics">US Holidays</a>, <a href="http://ical.mac.com/ical/Christian32Holidays.ics">Christian Holidays</a>, and <a href="http://ical.mac.com/ical/Red32Sox.ics">Red Sox Baseball</a>.
