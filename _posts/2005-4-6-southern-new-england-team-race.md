title: Southern New England Team Race
---
Connecticut College
March 26-27

After driving up all day Friday, we were psyched to get to sailing on Saturday morning. We won some key races, and lost some stupid ones - mostly our problems stemmed from not being on the same page a lot of times. On Sunday the story was much the same, we made the final rotation (6 teams), and finished 4th, but we did not feel like we had sailed to the best of our abilities. This weekend coming up we've got another team race, and hopefully this time we'll be able to get organized and sail well - I'm hoping we can all get some lunch and chat about our team racing beef.
