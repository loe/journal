title: Avalanche!
---
<p>Nucci and I finished up our Level 1 Avalanche class today, we even set off an avalanche while we were digging our snow pit! It had a 70cm crown, and was about 15m wide. The slope was the perfect 38 degrees (most avalanches at this pitch), and the snowpack had the right weakness to go. It took a lot of people (almost 20 of us walking around) to get the snow to collapse, and that collapse triggered the slide.</p>
