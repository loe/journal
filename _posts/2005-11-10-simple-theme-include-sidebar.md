title: Simple Theme & Include Sidebar
---
I'm releasing my theme, I've almost completely finished porting it from <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. The file linked here will always be the latest released version, right now I still need to add a few styles (comments things) and make sure all the views are how I want them. Theme requires <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">Typo 2.5.8</a>. I am also going to link up my "Include" sidebar module thingymambober. I made this so I could include my picture on the side, I'm going to make another that will be ajaxified. Basically it will reload the included file on a set delay (configurable in the admin area). Fun fun!
