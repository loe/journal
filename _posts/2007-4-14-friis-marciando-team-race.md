April 7-8 @ Tufts in Larks & MIT in FJs<br />
Erik Storck/Killarney Loufek, Andrew Loe/Betsy Bryant, Ben Sampson/Kate Hacker<br />

Saturday: We started at Tufts, and in typical fashion Mystic lake was... mystical. We sailed well, finishing 13-1 and staying out the protest room. The conditions were crazy but it appears we had it the best.

Sunday: After a fantastic Toga party, we arrived in glorious fashion to MIT. Conditions were windy and cold, and the RC decided that we would only sail one round-robin, not what we were expecting. We dropped some races due to a lack of communication. Our 4-3 record left us 4th overall, not satisfying but we have some ideas on what we need to work out.
