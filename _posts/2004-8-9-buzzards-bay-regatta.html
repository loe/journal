title: Buzzards Bay Regatta

Well, I'm back from <a href="http://www.buzzardsbayregatta.com/">BBR</a>, I had a good time sailing <a href="http://www.v15.org/">Vanguard 15</a>s. There were about 80 boats and I finished 7th, sailing with a 420 skipper who didn't get into the event. The party on Saturday night was alot of fun, nice to see old faces. I'm not really psyched to be back at school, but what can you do?
