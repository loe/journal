title: New iPod Firmware
---
In addition to the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodmini/">iPod Mini</a>s, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> has updated the software on its iPods. Specifically, my 3G now has the same interface as the 4G iPods, letting me put Shuffle songs on the main menu, and putting Playlists, Artists, etc. under Music on the main menu. This interface is a lot more intuitive (possible? only by Apple) than the older one. It also seems like Apple will enable older iPods (I'm assuming those with dock connectors only) to work with the photo download accessory, this would be very sweet, able to store photos even though we can't view them. The adapter is <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2005/02/20050223101743.shtml">rumored</a> to be out in March. So make sure you <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/download/">get the latest update</a>.
