title: This Season

"The storm is relentless. With six more inches down and more on the way, the air is electric with apprehension. It's almost exhausting, but then you remind yourself why you are here. It's seasons like these, speckled atop seas of mediocrity, that afford you a rare window to actualize the full potential of what you can be. Your goals become simple and immediate, your dreams obsess over untapped lines, and the static chatter of your world dissolves in the solace of the moment. Go, seize it." -NS
