I've been snowboarding quite a bit, unfortunately Nucci's camera has been acting up so I don't have any new photos to show you, but I do have a <a href="http://www.burton.com/Burton/gear/products.asp?productID=100&shortMaterialNumber=B5298105">new jacket</a>, which I will be showing off in the future!

I've also done a bit of sailing in the past month. The Charleston Intersectional was kinda lame, we only sailed on Saturday afternoon, no wind in the morning and again all day Sunday. We ended up tied for 5th in A (Adele and I) and 5th in B (Ben and Betsy), 4th overall. Not bad considering we hadn't raced sailed since November. The Charleston Team Race was much more eventful, we (Elisabeth/I, Storck/Clementine, and Peter/Liz) finished 2nd out of 8, and learned a lot. BC ran away with it, but they've been sailing together for a long time, so it was kind of expected.

The LC is going to the shop to get a much needed tune-up!
