title: Closing Weekend
---
Gaper Fool's day was Saturday, and it rolled into Sunday: the last public tram day, making for a weekend of crazy outfits, good fun, and general mayhem. Monday was Employee Ski Day got to say goodbye to all my new Jackson friends. I'm sure I'll be back on their couches sooner than they'd like. The Tram is done, and I'm done. Goodbye Jackson Hole!
